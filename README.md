# datalab-container
Repo to build a datalab container for the [CMU CSAPP Data Lab](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html), the container is built to mount in the code from a local volume and run, since the lab code is only available to verified instructors and has solutions in the code files so I don't want to publicly build the code into the container or push into this repo. Instructions to follow on how to use w/ the code files.
